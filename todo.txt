1. Makes sure AcitivtiesListData just keep fixed activities list
- As Capped Collections are circular, fixed-size collections that keep the activity model for each stream.
- The order of item follows the whats hot rule.
- The fixed-number will be provided by configuration.

2. Implement CacheListener when the cache item has been expired

3. Refactoring to apply SoftReference for EdgeContext and vertexContext

4. Applies Collections.unmodified for collections, to handle more better with case concurrency changes.

5.



  
//  Calendar calendar1 = Calendar.getInstance();
//  Calendar calendar2 = Calendar.getInstance();
//  calendar1.set(<your earlier date>);
//  calendar2.set(<your current date>);
//  long milliseconds1 = calendar1.getTimeInMillis();
//  long milliseconds2 = calendar2.getTimeInMillis();
//  long diff = milliseconds2 - milliseconds1;
//  long diffSeconds = diff / 1000;
//  long diffMinutes = diff / (60 * 1000);
//  long diffHours = diff / (60 * 60 * 1000);
//  long diffDays = diff / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
